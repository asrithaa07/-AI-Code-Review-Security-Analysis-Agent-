# Team Presentation & Meeting Guide

*Congratulations on being selected! Use this guide as a cheat-sheet when explaining the architecture, tech stack, and workflow to your team members.*

---

## 1. The Core Problem We Are Solving
Start the meeting by explaining *why* this project exists:
> "Manual code reviews are slow and often miss critical security flaws. We built a platform that instantly acts as a Senior Security Architect. A developer submits their code, and our multi-agent AI automatically scans it for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, writes the fixed code for them, and provides a dashboard to talk to the AI about the fixes."

## 2. Our Technology Stack (The "What")
Break the platform down into three distinct layers so it's easy for them to digest.

**Frontend (The Developer Portal)**
* **Next.js & React:** Extremely fast, modern UI framework.
* **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn:** For the premium, dark-mode styling and fluid components.
* **Chart.js:** Powers our dynamic 8-axis Security Radar Chart.

**Backend (The Engine)**
* **FastAPI (Python):** High-performance backend API handling concurrent requests.
* **SQLite / PostgreSQL:** For storing users, scan histories, and generated PDF reports.
* **ChromaDB:** A local vector database used to store our security knowledge base.

**AI & Orchestration (The Brains)**
* **LangGraph:** This is critical! We don't just make one API call. We use LangGraph to orchestrate a "team" of AI agents working together in a pipeline.
* **LangChain:** Handles our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) so the chatbot actually "reads" OWASP documents before answering.

## 3. The LLMs & Architecture
Your team will definitely ask what AI models are under the hood. 

* **Primary Engine:** **Google Gemini 3.6 Flash**. We chose this model because it is blazing fast, capable of handling massive code-context windows with pinpoint precision, and is excellent at generative refactoring and structured JSON outputs.
* **Embedding Model:** **BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5**. This is a powerful, lightweight local model running natively on our server that converts our OWASP security documents into vector numbers so the chatbot can search them.
* **Multi-Level Fallback Engine:** This is a major selling point of our architecture! We designed a robust fallback pipeline that prevents the system from ever crashing due to LLM rate limits or API exhaustion:
  - **Level 1 (Cloud Fallback):** If Gemini 3.6 fails, times out, or exhausts its quotas, the system automatically routes the request to **Grok (xAI)**.
  - **Level 2 (Offline Fallback):** If the entire internet or cloud LLMs go offline entirely, our orchestrator detects this and instantly bypasses all LLMs to rely on our native **Static AST Refactoring Engine**. It uses hard-coded rules to safely patch vulnerabilities without an internet connection!

## 4. The Exact Project Workflow (How It Works sequentially)
*Walk them through exactly what happens when a user clicks "Analyze" on the frontend.*

1. **Submission:** The user pastes Python or Java code in the Next.js UI. The frontend sends it to our FastAPI backend.
2. **LangGraph Pipeline Triggers:** FastAPI hands the code to our master Orchestrator agent.
3. **Parallel Scanning:**
   - The **Code Analysis Agent** scans for "smells" (like high cyclomatic complexity or deep nested `if` statements).
   - The **Security Vulnerability Agent** runs an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) static scan looking for OWASP vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Hardcoded Secrets, Command Injection). *Note: This step doesn't even use the LLM; it's instant and mathematically accurate.*
4. **AI Remediation:** The Orchestrator gathers these flagged issues and sends them to the **Remediation Agent (Gemini 3.6 Flash)**. Gemini writes the exact code required to fix every flag (e.g., parameterizing the SQL queries) and explains why it made the change.
5. **Scoring Compilation:** The **PR Summary Agent** calculates a definitive *Code Health Score (0-100)* using a strict penalty formula algorithm based on issue severity.
6. **Dashboard Delivery:** The data is pushed back to the frontend where the React dashboard renders the Radar Chart and interactive code-diffs.
7. **Conversational Follow-up:** If the user has questions, they can talk to the Chatbot, which uses ChromaDB RAG to pull up official documentation and answer questions instantly.

## 5. Most Important Files in the Codebase (Where the Magic Happens)
*If the panel asks to see the actual code, have these files ready to show off:*

1. **`backend/app/workflows/orchestrator.py`**
   - **Why it matters:** This is the core brain of the application. It contains the **LangGraph** nodes and edges that coordinate the agents. Show this to prove the system uses true Agentic orchestration, not just standard API scripts.
2. **`backend/app/agents/remediation_agent.py`**
   - **Why it matters:** This file contains the primary Gemini 3.6 Flash logic. It demonstrates how we instruct the LLM to take bad code, understand the syntax, and produce perfectly secure output without breaking the application logic. 
3. **`backend/app/agents/conversational_assistant.py`**
   - **Why it matters:** This is where the highly advanced **Multi-Level Fallback** exists! Open this to show how the system gracefully catches internet outages or Gemini timeouts and instantly routes to the offline Synthesis Engine.
4. **`frontend/src/components/security-radar-chart.tsx`**
   - **Why it matters:** The most visually impressive part of the frontend. Show this to demonstrate how we use complex React hooks to dynamically parse the security scan JSON and render the stunning, animated 8-axis data visualizations.

## 6. Core REST API Endpoints
*If the panel asks how the frontend and backend talk to each other, explain that we built a robust FastAPI REST backend:*

- **`POST /api/v1/analyze/submit`**
  - **The Workhorse:** This is the most crucial API. The frontend sends the raw source code payload here. It spins up the background LangGraph pipeline, saves the results to the SQLite database, and returns the unique `submission_id`.
- **`POST /api/v1/chat/message`**
  - **The Conversational Engine:** This API handles all live-chat queries. It accepts the user's question along with the current `submission_id` to provide secure, context-aware coding advice using ChromaDB RAG.
- **`GET /api/v1/github/auth-url` & `POST /api/v1/auth/token`**
  - **The Security Layer:** Demonstrates that the platform is production-ready. We enforce secure JWT (JSON Web Token) issuance and bcrypt password hashing before users can even access the portal.

### Tips for the Panel Presentation Tomorrow:
- **Lead with the Radar Chart:** Visually, it is stunning. Show them the Radar Chart immediately as it instantly communicates the value of the platform.
- **Show, Don't just Tell:** Run a piece of code that has a blatant SQL Injection or Hardcoded Password, and let them watch the code rewrite itself securely in real-time.
- **Drop the keyword "LangGraph":** Panel members love modern tooling. Emphasize that this isn't just a basic "ChatGPT wrapper"—it is a deterministic, multi-agent automated pipeline using LangGraph.
